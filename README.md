## Idea 1: Crime, Family Involvement, and Student Performance Before and During COVID-19
This project examines whether the relationship between neighborhood crime, family involvement, and student performance changed during the COVID-19 period. By comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic-era data, the analysis evaluates how disruptions to schooling, shifts in family engagement, and changes in local crime patterns altered educational outcomes.

## Idea 2: Replicating Crime–Education Analysis Across Urban Contexts
This project extends a prior analysis of the relationship between neighborhood crime, family involvement, and student performance by applying the same framework to a different  location. By holding methods constant and changing the context, this project group will evaluates whether observed patterns generalize across cities or neighborhoods, and identifies how local conditions shape the strength and direction of crime–education relationships.
